I am a sociologist and family demographer (PhD) at the Hungarian Demographic Research Institute in Budapest, Hungary. I am currently a senior research fellow and leader of the HDRI Data Lab. 

My research interests include transition to adulthood, changing partnership and fertility patterns in the life course. I regularly use international comparative data and multivariate methods such as panel analysis, event history analysis or multilevel models in my research.

Currently I study the typologies and trajectories of cohabiting unions and marriages in the new millennium. The project is funded by the János Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
